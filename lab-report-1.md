The working directory of these commands is /home.
For the cd command, having no arguments just means that there is no change to the directory. This is not an error.
For the ls command, having no arguments prompts the listing of files in the current working directory. This also is not an error.
For the cat command, having no arguments causes the terminal to continue asking for arguments in a loop. This causes an error since the cat command will cause the terminal to not be able to exit the code.
