I used vim to edit the file, and used `<tab>` to auto-complete the `ListExamples.java` file so that I don't have to type as much. I then used `<enter>` to run the command, and typed `43j e` to skip to the line 43 that needed the change and `e` to the end of the word `index1`. I then pressed `i` to enter insert mode, `<right> <delete> 2` to go right and replace 1 with 2, `<esc>` to get out of insert mode and `:wq` to save and quit vim.

I ran the command to add the edit, and used `<tab>` to auto-complete the file and `<enter>` to run the command. Then I committed the edit using `<enter>` to run the command, and pressed `<G>` to go to the end of the commit message, `<i>` to enter insert mode, `<right> <enter>` to create a new line for the message, typed out my message, and then used `<esc>`  to exit insert mode. I pushed the edit to github and used `<enter>` to run the command.
